# ðŸ“ƒ HTML Form Practice
Civil Registration Form is a simple web-based project designed to explore and practice the usage of HTML forms. The project simulates a basic civil registration process, similar to how official registration systems collect citizen information. In this project I only use HTML5.

Why civil registration? Personally, I see that civil registration requires quite a lot of information and requires various input formats, including plain text, numbers, and more.

I didn't actually include everything in this project, but at least there are many input variations and forms that can be applied here.

This project provides various input fields such as:
- Full Name.
- Date of Birth.
- Gender.
- Identification Number.
- Marital Status.

and so on..

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The main goal of this project is educational, helping me understand how to:
1. Build structured forms with HTML.
2. Apply different input types such as text, number, date, radio, checkbox, and textarea.
3. Add simple validation using built-in HTML attributes (e.g., required, type, maxlength).
4. Simulate real-world use cases of form-based data entry.

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes
By working with this project, I can:
- Gain familiarity with common HTML form elements.
- Understand how data can be collected through structured input.
- Lay the foundation for more advanced topics such as form handling with JavaScript or backend integration.
